#  phonegap-background plugin for Cordova / PhoneGap

This Plugin is inspired from [phonegap-backgroundjs](https://github.com/jocull/phonegap-backgroundjs) plugin

Now you can background JavaScript operations on iOS with PhoneGap!

## Usage

Example Usage: 

1. **Run in the background infinitely:**

```js
var timerCount = 0;
window.plugins.BackgroundJS.LockBackgroundTime(function(){}, function(msg){console.log(msg);});
setInterval(function() {
$('body').html(timerCount++);
},1000);
```

2. **Run in the background for specific amount of time(seconds):**

```js
var seconds = 10;
window.plugins.BackgroundJS.SetBackgroundSeconds(seconds, function(){}, function(msg){console.log(msg);});
```

3. **Stop running background tasks immediately:**

```js
window.plugins.BackgroundJS.UnlockBackgroundTime(function(){}, function(msg){console.log(msg);});
```

## Installation for Cordova 3.0.0

phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/hazemhagrass/BackgroundJS


This has been successfully tested on Cordova 3.0 to 3.1.


## Notes:
Be careful when using this, as Apple specifications are picky. If you're not using background audio or tracking location, your app may be rejected for background tasking guidelines. Read up, and write some code!

ALSO... Please don't kill my battery life just because you backgrounded more than you had to. You're not a special snowflake (yet) so play by the rules. Code smart, and make your app work right!
